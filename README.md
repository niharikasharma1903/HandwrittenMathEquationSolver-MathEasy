# HandwrittenMathEquationSolver-MathEasy

## Using Convolutional Neural Networks ##
### Incluing a GUI integreated with Handwriting and Speech Recognition and Wolfram Alpha Step-by-Step Solutions ###

The objective of this project was to build a model for assistance with simple math equations and intergrate it with a hands-on interface.

### Data Trained for the CNN ###
Digits: 0 through 9, Operators: + - / x ( ) ^ âˆš( )  ***{Source: ISI CROHME}***   Letter for equations : 'm'  ***{Source: EMNIST}***

### Model ###
The Model folder consists of the h5 and JSON files of the CNN model trained on the above mentioned data. 

### GUI ###
The Code folder has 3 more files with the GUI - for letter recognition, speech recognition and the final file is the GUI integrated with the model.
